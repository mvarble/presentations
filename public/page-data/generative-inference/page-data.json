Studying and simulating these models allows one to quickly build an intuition with distinguishing between probability and statistics. Once establishing the intuition of generative models, I explain different inference algorithms one may employ. These may be seen as having a machine learning 'flavor', in the sense that models may be parameterized through complex maps that are chosen via variational methods and may only be understood through their generation."}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
